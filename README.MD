# Euclid's Algorithm

In this project, the Euclid's Algorithm was implemented in C++ and its efficiency was compared to a linear function that returns the greatest common divisor.

## Description

The Euclid's Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers become equal, and the resulting number is the GCD.

In this project, the Euclid's Algorithm was implemented in C++. The code calculates the GCD of two numbers and compares its efficiency to a linear function that also calculates the GCD.
